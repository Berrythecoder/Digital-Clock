# Digital-Clock
I created a digital clock that counts the time, in real-time, by the second! Im currently working on developig it a little and adding some new features as well like set alarms, setting it up to be put in military time and giving the option to change it a well!

Take a look, code for yourself and let me know how it works for you! I used HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT to make sure the the times and dates were 
and are accurate for the timezones selected. feel free to go through the code and edit/change it how youd like to better fit your own style! have fun and enjoy!
