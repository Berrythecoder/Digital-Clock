# Digital-Clock

Take a look, code for yourself and let me know how it works for you! I used HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT to make sure the the times and dates were 
and are accurate for the timezones selected. feel free to go through the code and edit/change it how youd like to better fit your own style! have fun and enjoy!
